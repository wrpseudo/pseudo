2014-10-03:
	* (seebs) in fact, suppress a lot of sanity checks entirely for
	  did_unlink.
	* (seebs) merge get_file_path functionality into find_file_dev,
	  since you never call find_file_dev unless you want to do that.
	* (seebs) If a file is in the database by inode but not path,
	  don't try to create a new link for it.
	* (seebs) when renaming, the link of the "old" file name should be
	  contingent on whether *it* was in the database, not whether
	  the *new* name was in the database. Whoops.
	* (seebs) 1.6.2

2014-10-02:
	* (seebs) use sqlite3_bind_int64 for inodes.
	* (seebs) suppress path mismatch warnings for did_unlink.

2014-07-18:
	* (seebs) Make "server already offline" message into a debugging
	  message (PDBGF_INVOKE).
	* (seebs) 1.6.1

2014-07-17:
	* (seebs) Restrict symbol version restrictions to x86-64 and i386
	  rather than x86-64 and any old thing. Fixes build problems on ARM.

2014-07-11:
	* (seebs) merge in symbol version restrictions (slightly tweaked)
	  for Linux.

2014-07-10:
	* (seebs) Don't pass -L/usr/lib* for sqlite, because that's probably
	  the default.
	* (seebs) include sys/xattr.h explicitly for Darwin, also fix things
	  up so we aren't relying on seeing a declaration for our dummy
	  wrapper for fgetgrent_r which doesn't exist here.
	* (seebs) fix typo in xattr message
	* (seebs) make xattr work on Darwin, too.

2014-06-13:
	* (seebs) don't follow symlinks for lutimes.
	* (seebs) Use sizeof instead of strlen to initialize static value.

2014-05-27:
	* (seebs) start noticing umask, mask it out from open or mkdir
	  calls rather than relying on underlying open/mkdir to do it.
	* (seebs) add a test for umask and filesystem-vs-db modes.

2014-05-16:
	* (seebs) fchmodat: don't drop flags, report failures, to improve
	  compatibility/consistency. Cache the knowledge that
	  AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW gets ENOTSUP.
	* (seebs) mask out group/other write bits in real filesystem to
	  reduce risks when assembling a rootfs including world-writeable
	  directories.
	* (seebs) send a round-trip message to the server before exiting
	  if any messages have been sent, so the program won't exit before
	  the server processed those messages.
	* (pabigot) Don't memory-leak on checks for PSEUDO_UNLOAD, also
	  check the correct environment when spawning new things. (Contributed
	  by Peter A. Bigot).
	* (seebs) mask 022 back in too, when restoring a database mode.

2014-05-15:
	* (seebs) drop flags when calling fchmodat() to appease GNU tar.

2014-04-24:
	* (seebs) extended attribute support

2014-01-23:
	* (seebs) mknod wasn't calling mknodat.
	* (seebs) mkdirat wasn't recording the logical DB mode for directories

2014-01-22:
	* (seebs) notes on some Futures planning.
	* (seebs) Typo/formatting issue in man page.
	* (seebs) message formatting/clarity cleanup and typo fixes.
	* (seebs) First draft of passwd_fallback implementation.
	* (seebs) bump this all to 1.6.0.

2014-01-15:
	* (seebs) performance test/test case updates.

2013-06-20:
	* (seebs) refactor debugging code
	* (seebs) start using 1.5.2 numbering

2013-06-18:
	* (seebs) Fix bug in oldclone (reported by rich@noir.com).

2013-02-27:
	* (seebs) Oh, hey, what if I took out my debug messages?
	* (seebs) update docs a bit to reduce bitrot

2013-02-26:
	* (seebs) When built -DNDEBUG, completely drop pseudo_debug calls.
	* (seebs) Add PSEUDO_ALLOW_FSYNC to allow temporary re-enabling of
	  fsync to work around filesystem bugs.
	* (seebs) call that 1.5.1.

2013-02-17:
	* (seebs) Fix uninitialized variable in unlink, fix force-fsync for
	  Darwin (off64_t is not a distinct type there).

2013-02-16:
	* (seebs) Add wrapper setting which automatically returns a fixed
	  value from some wrappers. Add fixed-value wrappers for all the
	  *sync() functions. These are all contingent on --enable-force-async.

2013-02-15:
	* (seebs) Add support for in-memory DB. This, plus upcoming
	  fsync-related changes, are expected to be big enough to justify
	  calling this 1.5.

2013-02-13:
        * (seebs) calling link while chrooted could in some cases result
          in the root path not being prepended at all. One more try!
        * (seebs) 1.4.5.

2013-02-12:
        * (seebs) calling link while chrooted could in some cases result
          in the root path being double-appended.
        * (seebs) and tag 1.4.4 so that can get out as a clean update.

2013-01-31:
        * (seebs) tag 1.4.3 (to avoid any problems with the changes since
          1.4.2 and old tarballs)

2013-01-30:
        * (seebs) Subtle tweaks to avoid GLIBC_2.7 dependencies which
          can cause trouble trying to copy libpseudo.so to older hosts.
        * (seebs) add "with-sqlite-lib" to simplify cases where sqlite's
          libdir computation differs from what we otherwise want; for
          instance, with bitbake, we often end up wanting $lib = lib64,
          but $sqlite_lib = lib.

2012-12-13:
        * (seebs) tag 1.4.2.

2012-12-12:
        * (seebs) Remove extra tab from the path alloc code in
          makewrappers. (Which has no effect since I changed my mind about
          the implementation which would have made it show up.)
        * (seebs) linkat() implementation. as a side effect, clear up
          the documentation and behavior of link(2) to reflect host
          OS semantics: Linux will hardlink symlinks, Darwin will only
          hardlink their targets.
	* (seebs) make linkat() implementation compile/run on Darwin,
	  fix header bitrot for Mountain Lion.

2012-08-09:
	* (seebs) base_stat should be real_stat64, not stat64
	* (seebs) add stat64/lstat64/fstat64 wrappers to Linux (not
	  previously needed because the libc versions call stuff we
	  already wrap).

2012-08-02:
	* (seebs) fix some Darwin-specific bitrot for clang/llvm.
        * (seebs) Drop the _plain thing, convert unix/guts/* to use
          PSEUDO_STATBUF.
        * (seebs) Tag 1.4.1.

2012-07-27:
	* (seebs) Convert from .tgz to tar.bz2 since that's handier for
	  Yocto.

2012-07-24:
	* (seebs) Fix a couple of bitrots from the update.

2012-07-20:
	* (seebs) Add --cflags, deprecate --arch.
	* (seebs) tag 1.4 (since this should now work on arbitrary targets)

2012-06-28:
        * (seebs) Tag 1.3.1.

2012-06-27:
        * (seebs) Fix chroot coredump with long root path.

2012-04-30:
	* (seebs) Update README about new upstream.

2012-04-09:
	* (seebs) Improvements to rpath logic for sqlite, etc.
	* (seebs) Improvements to the logic for picking options
	  like -m32, -m64 (which is to say, on ARM:  Don't.)

2012-03-28:
	* (seebs) Cleanup unused variables, stray semicolons, add
	  comments to some unused functions which exist because the
	  wrapper generator makes them anyway.
	* (seebs) Make system() drop environment if PSEUDO_UNLOAD is
	  set.

2012-03-27:
	* (seebs) Merge in:
	* (mhatle) Improve configuration compatibility with OE-Core.
	* (seebs) Provide option to statically link libsqlite.
	* (seebs) 1.3 branch

2012-03-26:
	* (seebs) Add popen() call to set up environment.

2012-02-06:
	* (seebs) Merge O_LARGEFILE into flags, not mode (thanks to Lei
	  Liu at Wind River for the fix).

2012-02-02:
	* (seebs) stash dir name for DIR * from opendir using dirfd.
	* (seebs) add closedir.
	* (seebs) add initial pass at renameat()
	* (seebs) update makewrappers with smarter *dirfd handling.
	* (seebs) in base_path, don't try to strlen the result if
	  fd_path() returns NULL.

2011-11-02:
	* (seebs) Call this 1.2 because the UNLOAD change is moderately
	  significant, and so's the clone change.

2011-11-01:
	* (mhatle) Stop valgrind from reporting use of uninitialized
	  memory from pseudo_client:client_ping()

2011-10-26:
	* (mhatle) update clone wrapper to add an intermediate function
	  to avoid setting environment variables in the parent.

2011-10-20:
	* (mhatle) change from internal PSEUDO_RELOADED to external
	  PSEUDO_UNLOAD environment variable.  Enable external programs
	  to have a safe and reliable way to unload pseudo on the next
	  exec*.  PSEUDO_UNLOAD also will disable pseudo if we're in a
	  fork/clone situation in the same way PSEUDO_DISABLED=1 would.

2011-07-19:
	* (seebs) initialize a variable in that "realpath" code.

2011-06-08:
	* (seebs) Get the modern realpath from glibc instead of the old
	  one inexplicably proferred by RTLD_NEXT.  Fixes realpath(path, NULL)
	  when PSEUDO_DISABLED=1.

2011-06-06:
	* (seebs) revise system() handler substantially.  It now
	  pollutes the environment but works.
	* (seebs) Call it "1.1.1" so the nice folks doing Yocto
	  can have an official branch and not need to use git.
	* (seebs) add "tarball" make target.

2011-06-02:
	* (seebs) intercept system() so the pseudo environment is
	  properly set for it.
	* (seebs) call this "1.1" since the cumulative result of all
	  of these changes is pretty big.

2011-05-31:
	* (seebs) Don't mask in 0100 to filesystem modes for things which
	  are not actually directories, because this breaks the special
	  logic in euidaccess for X_OK.

2011-05-25:
	* (seebs) fix for ulckpwdf()

2011-04-21:
	* (seebs) don't use strerror in wrappers, because it can
	  lead to malloc deadlocks if part of setting up a malloc
	  operation falls into strerror which uses locale... Curse
	  you, Fedora 13.  You and your perfectly reasonable and
	  standards-conforming behavior which happened to inconvenience
	  me.

2011-04-16:
	* (seebs) remove duplicate definition of real_clone() from
	  the oldclone port.

2011-04-13:
	* (seebs) base_path of an empty string should be an empty string,
	  not $pwd.

2011-02-14:
	* (seebs) first pass on splitting out ports
	* (seebs) various cleanup
 
2011-02-10:
	* (seebs) pseudo_client_shutdown(), and the pseudo server, have to
	  be smart enough to make the local state directory in case the
	  pseudo binary is invoked directly by a user before being spawned
	  by the client.

2011-02-09:
	* (seebs) the long-awaited cleanup of the database initialization
	  code.  it's not really beautiful but it's quite a bit better.

	* (seebs) Get full paths for exec*()
