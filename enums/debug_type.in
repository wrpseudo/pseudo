# Note: For convenience/consistency with the old numerc debug levels
# stuff, these are sorted in a very rough approximation of "likelihood
# that the user will care." So, PSEUDO_DEBUG=1 will pick up the
# consistency checks. In general, most numeric debug levels will be
# significantly less chatty than they used to be; there was one
# level 5 message, I think, and nothing else above a 4. Which was a
# problem.
# Note: Descriptions should be under 32 characters to match the formatting
# in pseudo's help message.
